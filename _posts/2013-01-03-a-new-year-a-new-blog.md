I've never been much of a blogger and I don't intend to start now to be honest! I find [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jmwhittaker) to be a better medium for quick thoughts and questions.

I have wanted to rebuild and restart my blog for a very long time. The usual 'Cobbler's Children syndrome' I guess. So with 2013 comes a new start and time to get through my personal to-do list.

I'm keeping things very simple here. A simple minimal responsive design built with a [mobile first approach](http://www.netmagazine.com/interviews/luke-wroblewski-mobile-first). No fluff just thoughts.

What is different this time around is how this site is built and where it's hosted. Ditching Wordpress this time around, I have gone with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) a static site generator. It's so simple yet so powerful you can get it to do almost anything you desire. Hosting is through by [Github pages](http://pages.github.com/) and you can see the entire source code for the site on [Github](https://github.com/jmwhittaker/jameswhittaker).

Let's blog like it's 2013!
